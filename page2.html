        <h2>Top 5 Fan-Favorite Dragon Species</h2>
        <p>There are more than a hundred canonical dragon species in the movie series "How To Train Your Dragon".
           Due to this fact, this page will be limited to the top 5 fan-favorite dragon species and their riders (as applicable)
           that are not part of the main cast. But don't worry! I will add a link to a page that includes
           all the species of dragons towards the bottom of the page, if you wish to see them all!</p>
        <p>With that said, the dragons that I will be sharing on this page are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cloudjumper</li>
          <li>Thornado</li>
          <li>The Skrill</li>
          <li>Light Fury</li>
          <li>Crimson Goregutter</li>
